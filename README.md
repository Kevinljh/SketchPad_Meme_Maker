1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to give a detailed, itemized description of the FireKam Traffic Trend system functionality. The System is intended to give users immediate information about the surrounding environment.

1.2 Scope
The Traffic trend system is meant to give business owners and shoppers information about the traffic patterns and density of the surrounding environment. The benefit of this information is knowing where potential customers travel to strategically place advertisements in order to bring in business. The information could be used to redesign floor space as well to avoid traffic congestion and keep customers moving through shops. On the other spectrum customers might be able to access this information at a  kiosk by  an entrance of a mall and use it as a live map to help them avoid said congestion.

This information will be presented in multiple formats, including heat map, numerical charts, graphs, motion paths of least busy times of day for shopping, walking, etc. Also the heat map solution avoids the identity issues - without showing peopleâ€™s face and action.
